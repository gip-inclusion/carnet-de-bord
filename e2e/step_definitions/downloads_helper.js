		// the test script. Remember that the expected usage pattern
		// of the helper is:
		//  ```
		//  I.handleDownloadsToDirectory();
		//  I.click('link-to-download');
		//  ```
		// So this helper must resolve before the download has even been started.
		//
		// If the two lines above were reversed (`click` before `handleDownloadsToDirectory`)
		// we could await `page.waitForEvent`, but in that case we
		// would suffer from a race condition â€” if the download completes
		// between the `click` and the call to `handleDownloadsToDirectory`
		// then we'll never see a `download` event.
		//
		// This also means that this helper cannot meaningfully fail, so
		// `retryFailedStep` can't help us. This is why we have a large
		// timeout on `waitForEvent`, to allow sufficient time for the
		// expected download to complete.
